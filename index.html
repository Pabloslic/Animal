                <p class="notes">The Earth is home to an astonishing variety of life forms—from towering elephants and elusive snow leopards to delicate orchids and tiny frogs. However, a growing number of these species are now at risk of disappearing forever. These are our endangered species, and their plight is a clear warning about the fragile balance of life on Earth.</p>
                <p class="notes">A species is considered endangered when its population has declined so significantly that it is at high risk of extinction in the near future. This status is classified by organizations like the <span>International Union for Conservation of Nature</span> (IUCN), which maintains the <span>Red List of Threatened Species</span>.</p>
                <p class="notes">Endangered species are a reflection of the world we’re shaping. Saving them means saving the intricate web of life we all depend on. Through awareness, education, and action, we can ensure that these majestic creatures are not lost to history but continue to thrive for generations to come.</p>

                <h3>Vanishing Spots: The Plight of the</h3> 
                <h3>AMUR LEOPARD</h3>
                <p> In the remote forests of the Russian Far East and northeastern China roams one of the planet's most elusive and endangered creatures: the Amur Leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis). With fewer than 60 individuals left in the wild, this subspecies of leopard teeters on the edge of extinction.<br></p>
                <p> Designated by the "International Union for Conservation of Nature" (IUCN), the Amur Leopard's critical status is a stark indicator of how fragile Earth's biodiversity has become.</p>
                <div class="image5"><img src="/images/snow leopard.jpg" alt=""></div>
                <p>The Amur Leopard inhabits the temperate forests of the Primorye region in Russia, stretching slightly into northeastern China. These cold, rugged terrains are far from the African savannahs where their leopard cousins thrive. Thick snow, steep hills, and harsh winters shape the Amur Leopard's survival instincts.</p>
